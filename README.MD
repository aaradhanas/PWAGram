# PWAGram
A simple Instagram clone, implementing a lot of PWA features.

# What is a PWA?

PWA is the abbreviation for **Progressive Web Application**. It is a term referrring to a couple of features you can add to any web application to enhance it. You can progressively enhance your web apps to look and feel like native apps.

A PWA basically incorporates the pros of a native mobile application and a web application. It can have the reach of a web app and also use device features (like camera) of a mobile.

- **Reliable**: Load fast and provide offline functionality
- **Fast**: Response quickly to user actions
- **Engaging**: Feel like a native app on mobile devices

# PWA Features

- They are installable (without an App Store)
- They can work offline
- They look good on any device
- They can receive Push Notifications
- They can access native device features like camera.

# PWA Building Blocks

- Web App Manifest
- Service Worker

# Web App Manifest

This is a JSON filed named **manifest.json** which resides in the root folder of the app. The information present in this file is used by the browser to add the app to home screen of the mobile and also use it in the display of the app (Name, Short name, Icons, background color in splash screen, theme color of the app, etc.)

If you would like to know the browsers which support the web app manifest, please visit [Web App Manifest - Browser Support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-app-manifest)

[MDN Article on the Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) and [Web App Manifest Explanation by Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) provide detailed information about the supported properties.

# Service Workers

Before getting on to what service workers are, lets see the behaviour of normal JavaScript files attached to HTML pages. The JS files run on a single thread attached to individual HTML pages. They have the capability to manipulate the DOM.

### How do service workers differ from normal JS files?

- They are also JavaScript files, but they have access to a different set of features.
- They run on a separate **single thread**, because they run in the **background**.
- Even though they are registered through HTML pages, they are decoupled from them.
- They are not attached to a single page, but can manage pages of a given scope (e.g., all pages of a domain OR entire web app).
- They **live on** even after the web app has been closed in the browser (Remember, they are background processes).
- They cannot interact with the DOM and are not attached to a single page.
- Since they run in the background, they are very good at **listening/reacting to events** from:
    - Normal JS pages
    - HTML code
    - Another server (like web push notifications)

### What are the events the service worker can listen to?

1. **Fetch** - Browser or page-related JS initiates a Fetch (HTTP Request)
2. **Push Notifications** - Service worker receives Web Push Notifications (From server of browser vendors)
3. **Notification Interaction** - User interacts with displayed notification
4. **Background Synchonization** - Service Worker receives Background Sync Event (e.g. Internet connection was restored)
5. **Service Worker Lifecycle** - Service Worker Phase changes

### Lifecycle of a service worker

- Browser **registers** the service worker as a background process
- Browser then **installs** the service worker
- Browser then **activates** the service worker
- Service worker then goes to the **idle** state
- After idling for some time, if there are no events to react to, it then goes to the **terminated** state.
- In case of any events, the service worker is triggered to come back to the **idle** state for further actions.

**Service workers only work on pages served via HTTPS.**

# How to Use the App
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.
