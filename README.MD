# What is a PWA?

PWA is the abbreviation for Progressive Web Application. A PWA basically incorporates the pros of a native mobile application and a web application. It can have the reach of a web app and also use device features (like camera) of a mobile.

# Web App Manifest

This is a JSON filed named manifest.json which resides in the root folder of the app. The information present in this file is used by the browser to add the app to home screen of the mobile and also use it in the display of the app (Name, Short name, Icons, background color in splash screen, theme color of the app, etc.)
